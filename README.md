EToc plugin 0.1.3
=================

A plugin for a (somewhat) extended table of contents that works in a sidebar as well.

How to make a table of contents?
--------------------------------

Create a `[etoc]` shortcut separated by blank lines.

`[etoc]` gives a TOC without numbering.

`[etocs numbers]` generates one with numbers.

If used in "sidebar.txt" the TOC will of course show the headings from the main page (BTW, right now the title of the sidebar has to be `Sidebar`).

This code might eat all your data or nuke your server. Use at your own risk.

How to install?
---------------
1. [Download and install Yellow](https://github.com/datenstrom/yellow/).
2. [Download plugin](https://github.com/richi/yellow-plugin-etoc/archive/master.zip). If you are using Safari, right click and select 'Download file as'.
